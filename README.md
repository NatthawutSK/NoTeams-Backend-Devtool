This is a web-based project management tool that allows users to create teams, manage tasks using Kanban boards, upload files, and manage team members with different roles and permissions.

## Features

- **Team Creation**: Users can create teams and invite other members to join.
- **Kanban Boards**: Each team has a Kanban board to manage tasks. Tasks can be dragged and dropped between different stages (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Done).
- **File Management**: Team members can upload and manage files related to their projects.
- **Role-based Access Control**:
 - **Owner**: The team creator has full control over the team settings, members, files, and Kanban board.
 - **Member**: Regular team members have access to the Kanban board and files based on the permissions set by the owner.
